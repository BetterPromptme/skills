## What it does

This prompt instructs an image model to generate a 1080×1080 square corkboard “case board” that summarizes a user-specified movie as a clear, readable visual timeline: the movie title appears pinned at the top, 5–6 stylized Polaroid-like scene recreations with short handwritten captions are arranged in loose chronological order, and colored strings plus realistic corkboard ephemera (tacks, clips, torn notes, scribbles, arrows, coffee rings) connect plot points and characters under warm nostalgic lighting, while avoiding direct copyrighted stills or recognizable actor likenesses and maintaining balanced composition with minimal clutter.

## Inputs


### textInputs

Pass each text input using `--input <key>=<value>` flags.

| Variable key | Required? | Description | Defaults |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `Movie` | Required |  | (none) |



### Models and options

This skill's modality is: **`image`**.

To discover which `model` values you can use (and which `options` keys/values are valid for each model), run:

```bash
betterprompt resources --models-only --json
```

Then filter the returned JSON array to entries where `modality` is `"image"`.

## How to run

### Step 1: Collect inputs

First, run `betterprompt resources --models-only --json` and filter to `modality: "image"` to discover valid models and available options:

```bash
betterprompt resources --models-only --json
```

Use only the models and option values that appear in the filtered results.

Then collect all inputs from the human:


- Required text inputs:
    - `Movie`
- Optional: model and options.
  - Present the human with the default model **`gemini-3-pro-image-preview`** and its available options. Look up `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` in the `betterprompt resources` output (filtered to modality `"image"`) and show its `availableOptions` as: `key: val1, val2 (default), val3  |  key2: ...`. Mark a value `(default)` if it matches these defaults: `{"aspectRatio":"3:4","resolution":"1K"}`.
  - If the human does not specify, defaults are used: model `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`, options `{"aspectRatio":"3:4","resolution":"1K"}`. Other models from the resources call are also available.

If any required text input is missing, **ask the human for what's missing**. Do not assume or fabricate values.

### Step 2: Run via BetterPrompt CLI

Use the frontmatter's `name` as the positional argument (for this skill, use `corkboard-story-layout`).

Command form:

```bash
betterprompt generate corkboard-story-layout \
  [--input <key>=<value>] \
  [--model <model>] \
  [--options <options JSON>] \
  [--json]
```

Notes:

- Pass each text input as a separate `--input <key>=<value>` flag.
- If the human does **not** mention a model, **omit** `--model` and BetterPrompt will use the default model: **`gemini-3-pro-image-preview`**.
- If the human does **not** mention options, **omit** `--options` and BetterPrompt will use the default options: **`{"aspectRatio":"3:4","resolution":"1K"}`**.
- If the run times out, the response will include a `runId` you can use to fetch the result later.

Example (using defaults shown above):

```bash
betterprompt generate corkboard-story-layout \
  --input Movie=<value> \
  --model gemini-3-pro-image-preview \
  --options '{"aspectRatio":"3:4","resolution":"1K"}'
```
