description: This prompt instructs the AI to transform an uploaded nail photo into a high-end, realistic salon advertising image by keeping the original nail design exactly the same while generating a premium studio composition: two hands posed elegantly with one resting over the other, dramatic directional lighting from the upper left to emphasize glossy highlights, and a clean solid-black background. The intended outcome is an ultra‑high‑resolution, tightly framed promotional photograph that looks commercially shot and retouched, with natural skin texture preserved and no added elements like jewelry, text, or environmental scenery.

## What it does

This prompt instructs the AI to transform an uploaded nail photo into a high-end, realistic salon advertising image by keeping the original nail design exactly the same while generating a premium studio composition: two hands posed elegantly with one resting over the other, dramatic directional lighting from the upper left to emphasize glossy highlights, and a clean solid-black background. The intended outcome is an ultra‑high‑resolution, tightly framed promotional photograph that looks commercially shot and retouched, with natural skin texture preserved and no added elements like jewelry, text, or environmental scenery.

## Inputs



### imageInputs

This prompt requires **exactly 1 image**. You **must pass exactly 1 image flag** (no more, no fewer), in the order matching the descriptions below.

| Index | Required | Description | Allowed CLI flags |
| ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Yes | Upload your nails photo | `--image-input-url <url>` or `--image-input-base64 <base64>` or `--image-input-path <absolute path to image>` |


### Models and options

This skill's modality is: **`image`**.

To discover which `model` values you can use (and which `options` keys/values are valid for each model), run:

```bash
betterprompt resources --models-only --json
```

Then filter the returned JSON array to entries where `modality` is `"image"`.

## How to run

### Step 1: Collect inputs

First, run `betterprompt resources --models-only --json` and filter to `modality: "image"` to discover valid models and available options:

```bash
betterprompt resources --models-only --json
```

Use only the models and option values that appear in the filtered results.

Then collect all inputs from the human:

- Required images:
  - **Exactly 1** images: image 1 (Upload your nails photo). Images must be provided in this order.
- Optional: model and options.
  - Present the human with the default model **`gemini-3-pro-image-preview`** and its available options. Look up `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` in the `betterprompt resources` output (filtered to modality `"image"`) and show its `availableOptions` as: `key: val1, val2 (default), val3  |  key2: ...`. Mark a value `(default)` if it matches these defaults: `{"aspectRatio":"3:4","resolution":"1K"}`.
  - If the human does not specify, defaults are used: model `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`, options `{"aspectRatio":"3:4","resolution":"1K"}`. Other models from the resources call are also available.

If the required images are missing, **ask the human for what's missing**. Do not assume or fabricate values. Tell the human: **"Please provide images in this order: image 1 (Upload your nails photo)"**.

### Step 2: Run via BetterPrompt CLI

Use the frontmatter's `name` as the positional argument (for this skill, use `professional-nail-salon-promotion-photo`).

Command form:

```bash
betterprompt generate professional-nail-salon-promotion-photo \
  [--image-input-url <url>] \
  [--image-input-base64 <base64>] \
  [--image-input-path <absolute path to image>] \
  [--model <model>] \
  [--options <options JSON>] \
  [--json]
```

Notes:

- Pass each image using one of `--image-input-url`, `--image-input-base64`, or `--image-input-path`, in the order matching the imageInputs descriptions (image 1 first, then image 2, etc.).
- If the human does **not** mention a model, **omit** `--model` and BetterPrompt will use the default model: **`gemini-3-pro-image-preview`**.
- If the human does **not** mention options, **omit** `--options` and BetterPrompt will use the default options: **`{"aspectRatio":"3:4","resolution":"1K"}`**.
- If the run times out, the response will include a `runId` you can use to fetch the result later.

Example (using defaults shown above):

```bash
betterprompt generate professional-nail-salon-promotion-photo \
  --image-input-url https://example.com/image1.png \
  --model gemini-3-pro-image-preview \
  --options '{"aspectRatio":"3:4","resolution":"1K"}'
```
